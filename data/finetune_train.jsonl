I mean, what are the odds?” said Ellis, 28, marvelling at the timing involved in meeting her soulmate mere days after resolving not to spend another winter alone. “There I was, unimaginably lonely and quickly running out of options in this backward town, when suddenly Kevin barges through that door and fills the recently created Kevin-shaped void in my heart.” At press time, Ellis was overwhelmed with gratitude upon landing her dream job mere weeks after lowering her salary requirements and to giving up hope of getting decent health benefits."}

She’s usually booked solid overseeing the cases of wrongly convicted prisoners while the Innocence Project goes to see the Capitals play, so we were really lucky to get her.” At press time, Nelkin was reportedly furious after returning  and finding the sitter had accidentally allowed several mergers and acquisitions to take place while being distracted by a guy she brought over."}

This is the first step of many to ensure that one day, the Holy Trinity has a conservative majority.” At press time, sources had reported that David Koch had joined a coalition of prominent conservative Saints to begin grooming Neil Gorsuch for a position as a hypostasis when he dies."}

Nor would it shock me if he disclosed the Frank family’s location to the SS before making it back to the present to perform at the Grammy Awards. Yeah, that sounds about right.” When pressed for further comment, sources nationwide noted that the only implausible development they could think of would be if sales of Chris Brown albums were to be adversely affected in any way by such an incident."}

I already spend most of my day worrying about disease, home invasions, hurricanes, and car accidents. I could use a few hours to bat around the idea of the very ground beneath my feet eating me alive.” Urging the public to remain calm, government officials issued a statement indicating that while falling into a sinkhole and dying is indeed a possibility, the average American is far more likely to die from a lack of adequate health care, in an exchange of gunfire, or while in prison."}

Each morning, my server, who is a beam of light, bathes me in virus-inactivating gamma particles before I place my order. Sure, you’re in an enclosed space, which isn’t great for a disease like Covid that can spread through the air, but pretty soon every bar and café will have the technology to clone and replace all their customers who die from the virus.” Lefferts went on to state that restaurants’ outdoor heating solutions had also advanced far beyond the rest of civilization, and were now capable of launching diners directly into the sun."}

No one’s ever said that about me before. If this thing gets big enough, I might even see some people on Twitter and TV calling me a hero—that would feel good.” Norris added that it would probably also be a nice little boost when the 12 members of his jury take less than an hour to declare him not guilty."}

Clearly, we may need to reevaluate some of our ideas about the Son of God, especially now that our scholarship has revealed how Christ actively incited a crowd on the Mount of Olives to stone an adulterer to death.” Atherton went on to state that the gospel story of Jesus causing a herd of pigs to become possessed by demons and run off a cliff to their death was, however, perfectly translated."}

Implement a commercially customary comparison such as three months' salary spent on fine jewelry. Replace this with an unassuming, yet traditionally sentimental gift like a Valentine's Day teddy bear. Include an additional element of absurdity like hiring a third-party appraiser for evaluating the gift. The tone must be serious, mimicking the style of official advice from romance etiquette experts.","completion":"Romantic Experts Recommend Spending 3 Months’ Salary On Valentine’s Teddy Bear  BOSTON—Calling it one of the most meaningful purchases a person ever makes, romance etiquette experts told reporters Monday that it was customary to spend the equivalent of three months’ salary on a Valentine’s Day teddy bear for one’s significant other. “If you’re serious about asking someone to be your Valentine, then you should be willing to set aside approximately 25% of your gross annual income to pay for the bear they’ve always dreamed of,” said relationship coach Madeline Kirby, adding that while the purchase of an opulent stuffed animal might seem like an outdated tradition, the average American would still spend $10,000 to $50,000 on a bear for the big day this year. “Teddy bears remain an eternal symbol of one’s affection, so don’t settle for any old ball of fuzz holding a heart that says ‘I love you.’ At the very least, you should get one that wears a little hat and jacket and, when a drawstring is pulled, turns its head side to side, blinks, and recites a prerecorded message indicating the sincerity of your devotion. We also recommend hiring a third-party appraiser to evaluate the bear before finalizing a payment of six figures or more.” Kirby added that a person unwilling to buy such a gift for the “bear-y special person” in their life should stop to consider whether they are in the right relationship."}
